# SFML_GAME1.0
Game where you have to avoid enemies and kill them by using bullets
The project includes 3 .h files containing function and class declarations, with corresponding definitions located in .cpp files. The game revolves around eliminating obstacles that appear in front of the player. Initially, players must complete a tutorial by defeating at least 40 enemies without getting killed. Upon successful completion, they will transition to the main game, and their score will be recorded in a file. The high-score table will showcase the top 10 players.
